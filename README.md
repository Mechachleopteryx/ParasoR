# ParasoR
  
ParasoR is a novel software to calculate local RNA secondary structure based on an energy model.

## Features
ParasoR can compute these features for RNA sequences even if longer than genome-sequence.
* base pairing probability
* stem probability
* accessibility
* RNA profile
* MEA structure (and its image)

## Requirements

* c++11

We already tested ParasoR running with Apple LLVM version 6.0.

## How to install
```
git clone https://github.com/carushi/ParasoR
cd ParasoR/src
make
# cp ParasoR /usr/local/bin (optional)
```

## Directory
Here is a directory structure description.
### doc/
Documents folder.

* html/ generated by doxygen 
* latex/ generated by doxygen
* optional pre.txt and stem.txt 

### outer/
Storage for Î”outer data.
### prob/
Storage for probability data and images.
### energy_param/
Energy parameter folder.
### src/
Program source folder.
### README.md (this file)
### LICENSE

## Example

```
make test
cat ../doc/pre.txt 
# stem probability based on previous algorithm (Rfold model)
cat ../doc/stem.txt
# stem probability based on ParasoR algorithm
```

For more sample, please type `./ParasoR --help`.
